Projects I've done while learning Data Science

From the earliest to latest projects:

1. DA_1 Real estate market research - We need to research the data for further measure of the appartment market price. 
Also our target is creating of standart parameters. It will help us to
determine some anomalies and illegal activity.
Used libraries: pandas, matplotlib

2. DA_2 Global videogames market research - We have to find patterns of successful videogame. Than we will choose
the most promising platform for the future game development.
Used libraries: pandas, scipy, mathplotlib, re

3. ML_1 mobile tariff recommendation - We need to build the recommendation system which analyzes clients behavior and offers 
a new tariff to a client - Smart of Ultra.
Used libraries: pandas, seaborn, sklearn

4. ML_2 forecasting bank customer churn - Bank marketing specialists had a research and noticed that
retaining customers is cheaper than attracting new ones. There is a need to predict of churn bank clients.
Used libraries: pandas, matplotlib, sklearn

5. ML_3 choosing a region for oil development - Oil company "doesn't_matter_oil" needs to choose a location for drilling a well. 
We need to build the ML-model which will help to choose the region with maximum profit and minimum risk.
Used libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn

6. ML_4 gold recovery - Preparation of a prototype of a machine learning model for the company develops solutions for the efficient 
operation of industrial enterprises. The model should predict the recovery coefficient of gold from gold-bearing ore based on the ore 
parameters at different stages of enrichment.
Used libraries: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn

7. DS_1 data protecting by math - We need to protect insurance company customers personal data.
Our target is to create the method of data transformation which makes data recovery almost impossible.
It's important to protect the data so that the quality of machine learning models does not degrade after the transformation.
Used libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, sklearn

8. ML_5 car price prediction - Service for the sale of used cars "Not broken, not painted" is developing an app.
In the app you can quickly find out the market value of your car by its parameters.
We need to build ML-model to determine the car cost.
Used libraries: pandas, seaborn, sklearn, CatBoost, LightGBM

9. ML_6 prediction of taxi orders - To attract more drivers during peak load, we need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour.
We'll build a model for such a prediction.
Used libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, CatBoost

10. ML_7 identifying toxic comments - We need to build ML-model which will classify online store comments to positive and negative.
Used libraries: pandas, numpy, re, sklearn, nltk, CatBoost

11. ML_8 age determination by photo - create and train computer vision ML-model which can determine human age by photo.
Used libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, keras, Adam, ResNet50

12. ML_9 telecom churn prediction - Mobile provider "Vympelphone.com" wants to predict clients churn and we shoul create ML-model for this aim.
Used libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, phik, sklearn, CatBoost, OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler
